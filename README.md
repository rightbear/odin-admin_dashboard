# odin-admin_dashboard
Project: Admin Dashboard

This is the seventh project to work after finishing the "Intermediate HTML and CSS Course"

Github page: https://rightbear.github.io/odin-admin_dashboard/

(2025/03/23) I complete this project with knowledges of HTML and CSS I learned in the previous course. I combine two display methods, flex and grid, to design the website. Futhermore, I use advanced CSS concepts such as custom text styles, positoning, child combinator, pseudo-classes, variable and more. With advices in Assignment of the project, I mainly use the concept of grid to design the general layout. This activity strengths my skills in HTML and CSS.
